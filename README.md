# Multithreaded-Matrix-Multiplication
Within this repository exists: 2 different Java codes (One for a Multithreaded Matrix Multiplication algorithm which supports custom thread amounts, and the other for a single threat matrix multiplication), matrix_benchmark_results.csv file containing the correlations between the Thread Amount-Performance statistics, 1000x1000 matrix input txt file and finally a .bat file in which inputs number of different thread count values in order to run these two codes called run_matrix_benchmark.bat
